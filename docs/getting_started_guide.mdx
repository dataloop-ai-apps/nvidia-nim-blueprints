# Getting Started Guide
The workdir/nvidia-demo project is a Python-based project that utilizes various configuration files to define its architecture and components. The project has a modular design with separate components and tasks defined in the configuration files.

## Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:
- `config`: This directory contains configuration files for the project, including `documentation_agents.yaml`, `documentation_tasks.yaml`, `planner_agents.yaml`, and `planner_tasks.yaml`.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup Instructions
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
2. Configure the project by modifying the configuration files in the `config` directory.

## Component Relationships
The components of the project are related as follows:

```
This diagram shows the relationship between the configuration files, the requirements file, and the Python dependencies.

## Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
2. Run the project by executing the Python script.

## Troubleshooting Scenarios
In case of issues, check the following:
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify the configuration files are properly set up.

## Example Use Case
For example, to install the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the required Python dependencies for the project.

## Conclusion
In this guide, we have covered the setup instructions, component relationships, and example use cases for the workdir/nvidia-demo project. By following these steps and troubleshooting tips, you can get started with the project and understand how to configure the system.
